The Jellyfin team **NEVER** takes money for running or accessing any server.

Running such server or providing access to one for any cost, is not just against our [community rules](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/community-standards/) but also illegal.
We cannot and will not provide any support for those scenarios, neither to the operator of those servers nor to clients. If you paid for access to a jellyfin server, we cannot help you as we dont have control over anyones jellyfin server.

A more detailed response on that topic is [written here](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/community-standards/servers/)
