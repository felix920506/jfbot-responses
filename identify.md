If you are experiencing problems related to jellyfin mislabeling your media, try the following process:
1. Move the effected shows or movies OUT of the library folder.
2. Initiate a scan of the library from the server dashboard > libraries.
3. Rename them to ensure they comply with the official [documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/movies).
4. Move the now correctly named shows and movies back to their library folder.
5. Intiate another scan.
